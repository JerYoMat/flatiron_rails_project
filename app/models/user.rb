#Steps for remember me feature
#1Create a random string of digits for use as a remember token.
#2Place the token in the browser cookies with an expiration date far in the future.
#3Save the hash digest of the token to the database.
#4Place an encrypted version of the userâ€™s id in the browser cookies.
#5When presented with a cookie containing a persistent user id, find the user in the database using the given id, and verify that the remember token cookie matches the associated hash digest from the database.
