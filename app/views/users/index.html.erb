<h1>User Index</h1>
<!--uses will-paginate gem to limit the number that appears at once this also needs to be implemented at the index action within the users controller-->


<ul class="users">

  <%= render @users%> 
</ul>

<!--Each of the will_paginate items adds in a little bar with page numbers.  Putting one at the top and bottom is merely for being friendly to users -->

<!-- will_paginate iterates through users on its own so by refactoring the user bit we wish to display we can make this form very concise -->
